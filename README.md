# Iris Flower Classification - Decision Tree

This is a simple machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** using a Decision Tree classifier.

## Files Included

- `iris-flower-ML-code.py`: Python code that loads the dataset, trains the model, and prints the accuracy.
- `0 - Machine Learning-Iris Classification.pptx`: Presentation explaining the dataset, model, and results.
- Screenshots showing code and output (optional visual support).

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning containing:
- 150 samples
- 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## Model

- **Model Used**: DecisionTreeClassifier (from `sklearn.tree`)
- **Train-Test Split**: 70% training, 30% testing
- **Accuracy**: Printed after evaluation

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python and the following libraries:
  pip install pandas scikit-learn

2. Run the code:
   python iris-flower-ML-code.py


## Notes

- This code is compatible with any standard Python environment.
- Originally tested on Nvidia Jetson Nano (but works everywhere).
